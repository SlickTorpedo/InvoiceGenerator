# InvoiceGenerator

This is a really simple invoice generator for your customers!

**NOTE**

If your page looks like this:\n
<img src="https://nexussociety.net/invoices/img/example.png"/>

It's nothing wrong with the code! You need to specify your variables.

All the variables are GET requests. So if the top of your page has "company_name Invoice" it means the variable "company_name" is not specified.

To fix this, just add ```?companyname=WhateverYourCompanyIsCalledHere``` to your URL!

Also, for multiple arguments the first one is ?argument=Value but then after that the url will become

```?argument=Value&argument2=OtherValue&argument3=OtherNeatValue```

For questions contact ```Slick#7454``` on discord!

This code is open source, you may modify it as you wish! If you don't give me credit there's nothing I can do about it but it would be nice if you did :)
